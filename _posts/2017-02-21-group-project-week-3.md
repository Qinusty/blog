title: Group Project Week 3
---

This week I was assigned with reading the SEQA.09 document which detailed the coding style we must follow while writing Java Code, something I had been doing for the past
two weeks. I decided that this would be a great point to go back and spend the week refactoring my current implementation as well as fully documenting my code. Reading the document was 
the first hurdle as it contains plenty of sections regarding various things which must be considered when following the style guide, for example, indentation must be 3 spaces 
throughout the project, meaning I had to go through and reformat all of my current files which were indented with 4 spaces. I ensured each Class met the QA standards in 
regards to documentation and style guide. I also decided to take a look into anonymous classes as to implement card actions which can be passed into a constructor for Cards. I figured
out how easy this would be to do and implemented 3 quick examples to show my group how it's done. 

# Time Spent:

- 1 Hour: Reading SEQA.09
- 4 Hours: Documenting all Classes
- 2 Hours: Refactoring current Classes
- 2 Hours: Anonymous Class Research
