title: Group Project Week 5
---

This week I spent a huge amount of time on writing code on trains to get the
work that Kamyab had done in previous weeks, working with our current
architecture and implementing visual features such as movement, rotation and
battles. The game has made a lot of progress and is actually playable however a
lot of the feedback to the user is given through the console as we have not
started. Also added Bay class as they were previously just Ports.

# Time Started:


- 8 Hours: Implementing Movement, Rotation, Combat
- 2 Hours: Documentation
