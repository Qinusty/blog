title: 'Group Project: Week 1'

This week I was assigned the task of creating the initial architectural design with Alex, we decided to create a Google doc, so that we could collaborate our initial ideas onto a page.
I threw down my ideas of individual classes and what each would contain, I had implemented similar game like architectures in the past so I took inspiration from them. Alex wrote 
some comments over my ideas, pointing out a few changes that could be made and what could be added including ways we could implement the treasure and its value. I think our initial design
should get us off to a good start, we may uncover some weaknesses during the implementation, however we can adjust as necessary. 

# Weekly Diary
Time Spent: 
- 1 hour task: Share initial thoughts with Alex via Google Docs and iron out any problems.
