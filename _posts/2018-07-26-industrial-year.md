title: 'Industrial Year'

This blog post summarises my experiences and thoughts surrounding my industrial
year placement out of university.

## Area of Indsutry
I spent my year working in a consultancy which was primarily based around product
design (Mechanical, Design, Electronics, Software etc). The majority of the
company were mechanical engineers, with a large number of indstrial designers
and a smallish team of electronics and software.

### Advantages
The advantage of working in a company which isn't solely a software house, is that
you get to meet a wide range of interesting people with varying experiences throughout
their careers and education. Alongside this, I found that it was quite easy to become
comfortable around the members of the software and electronics team due to the limited
numbers.

An advantage primarily related to working for a consultancy is the relatively short term
projects, giving you options to move around and work on a variety of software projects
during an industrial year such as mine.

### Disadvantages
The slight downside to working somewhere which doesn't solely specialise in software
is that the infrastructure in place isn't there to support the software team and their
developments. Primarily, the lack of resource into development procedures lead to the use
of software processed which had become dated and a slight hinderence on a daily basis to each
member of the software team.

### Projects
As I mentioned above, I got the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects from internal tools,
to developing prototype software for clients. Over my year, I was not only given the opportunity to work
on a wide range of projects, but also work with a wide range of technologies. To summarise I
have listed some of the technologies I worked with during my year out:

- Python 3
- Android (Java)
- C
- STM32
- TI SensorTag 2650
- ARM Cortex M0+
- Software Lifecycle Management Tools
- C#

## Things to take away
A year out from University during my studies was the best choice I have made so far in my education.
In the workplace, you are provided with constant challenges to learn and improve alongside people
who are usually more than happy to help you with any queries you might have.

A few extra points to remember:
- Never sit there confused and not knowing what to do. Just ask somebody.
- Code review is one of the best things to help you improve your code quality.
  - Review others
  - Have your code reviewed
- Enjoy having some money before you go back to being a student.
