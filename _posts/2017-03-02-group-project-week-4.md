title: Group Project Week 4
---

This week I was tasked with continuing the work on the architecture code with the aim of getting a JavaFX working using Kamyab's research.
This proved quite challenging as translating what Kamyab had done as a working prototype was a great start and had great choices made for
which JavaFX nodes we would use to get the desired layout. The issues I faced mostly surrounded the Object Oriented approach to our architecture
and having the objects plug into the UI with direct control over their own elements. This means that for example the Board controls the
GridPane which holds all of the tiles, and each tile can add itself to the appropriate place on the grid with the correct graphic and size.

This week we also had two reviews and a meeting, adding up to 4 hours of meetings in total after the meeting with Wayne on Friday. I feel we
reviewed each document thoroughly and weeded out any potential mistakes or issues, I'm happy with our submissions.

# Time Spent:


- 5 Hours: JavaFX Implementation
- 4 Hours: Meetings
- 1 Hour: Further Documentation.
