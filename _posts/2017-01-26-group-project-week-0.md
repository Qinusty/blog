title: 'Group Project: Week 0'
---

This is my first blog post, Here I will document my thoughts on the brief
provided to me today.

# The Project - Buccaneer
From a general viewpoint, the project seems like a fairly complex problem with
lots of different factors. Our first steps to tackling this project should be
thinking up ways to approach each aspect of the project such as Object Oriented
Design and a possible User Interface.

## The Group
My group seem motivated and happy with the project specification and the group
allocated. I have created a group channel for us all to communicate through
Facebook Messenger to increase communication within the group. This also helps
with the unfortunate fact that I am unable to make my first group tutorial
meeting on the 3rd of February due to attending a conference I had planned prior
to the timetables being released. This group will allow me to stay in contact
with my group during the tutorial and discuss the tutorial with them afterwards.

Looking at the roles Chris mentioned would be assigned during the first week, I
think I am most suited to do the Architecture proposal, as I have a firm grasp
on Object Oriented Design and experience implementing ideas into an Object
Oriented Design. However, I am also quite comfortable with the other roles
mentioned, primarily programming the on-screen display. Despite not being
completely comfortable with JavaFX, the framework I presume we will use to
design this interface, I would enjoy to give it a go and see what I can throw
together.

## Project Management
Despite not having had our first tutorial yet, I have suggested to my group the
possibility of using [trello](http://www.trello.com) as it is a free service
which provides a nice interface for managing tasks among a group and keeping
track of what has and hasn't been done.
