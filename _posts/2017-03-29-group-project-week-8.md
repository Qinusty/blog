title: Group Project Week 8
---

This week we were all tasked with working on the design document. I was tasked with the UML diagrams, so I decided to clean up the code and create the UML diagram for inheritance and dependencies from the existing code.

I also re-generated the JavaDoc pages to go with the design document to meet the requirement for an interface description.

# Time spent:

- 4 Hours: Code and documenting.
- 3 Hours: Diagrams
- 2 Hours: Working on the document
