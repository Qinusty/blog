title: Group Project Week 8
---

This week we were all tasked with working on the design document. I was tasked with the UML diagrams, so I decided to clean up the code and create the UML diagram for inheritance and dependencies from the existing code.

I also re-generated the JavaDoc pages to go with the design document to meet the requirement for an interface description.

While working on the document, matching functional requirements to classes, I
noticed a few bugs within the logic of our game which did not quite match the
requirements. I added these to our list of bugs with detailed descriptions to be
fixed in the future.

I also added the functionality for FR17 by adding end of game detection and
asking the players whether or not they want to play again
