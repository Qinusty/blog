title: Group Project Week 7
---

This week I focused on tidying up my diagrams and working towards the Design Document. I also wrote the code to handle the initialisation of non player ports to meet FR10's requirements.

I also modified existing code to prevent chain fights happening. This involved adding a new game state (PostCombatMoveState). To help people get into programming tasks
I ran the javadoc tool and put all of the docs into the repository so that people can refer to them when they're lost. This will also be used for the Interface Description within
the Design Document at a protected scope as it allows for easy reference to available methods and how each class works including all of its public/protected methods.



# Time sheet:


- 4 Hours: Diagrams.
