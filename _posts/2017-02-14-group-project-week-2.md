title: Group Project Week 2
---

This week I was assigned with the task of refacatoring the architecture design
and performing some exploratory work into implementing the design in Java. 

I spent 4-5 hours implementing the classes we had described within our UML
diagram, tweaking a few things when necessary as I noticed problems as part of
my spikework.

After my implementation, I modified a few of our designs to deal with the issue
of having multiple different tiles for an island. This was fixed by having a
container reference shared between each tile.

I have also read the Java QA docs and will refactor code to meet QA standards
for next week.
