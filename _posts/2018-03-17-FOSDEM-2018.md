title: 'FOSDEM 2018'
---
Once again I returned to FOSDEM for the third year running, this year I had come with
[AberCompSoc](abercompsoc.github.io) and [DCA](www.dca-design-com) (Where I am doing my industrial year placement). With
AberCompSoc I travelled from London via EuroStar which was a strange experience
as I had usually flown to Brussels, with the train only taking 2 hours it was a
great experience. Once again, I had somehow managed to avoid the famous FOSDEM
beer night on the friday, this time because I spent the majority of my weekend
at FOSDEM ill. Despite being ill, I was not put off attending the conference as
each year I had attended, I had a great time and learnt about a lot of cool
ongoing projects within the open source community.

## Saturday
For the first day of the conference, I had my eyes on a few talks I particularly
wanted to attend. Primarily I had hoped to get a seat in a few of the GoLang
talks, however this was clearly the case for everyone else as the room was
full all day. I did manage to attend a few interesting talks throughout the day
though, including [Python 3: 10 years
later](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/python3/) which was well
presented and covered a wide range of problems python faced in it's early
years of transitioning to python 3. Another great talk which I attended was the
[Multitasking on Cortex-M class
MCUs](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/multitasking_on_cortexm/) which
contained a brief introduction to the Cortex-M MCUs and how to use Chromium EC
to support your development. 

## Sunday
By Sunday I was feeling slighty better and more up to the task of tackling the
rain and snow Brussels was kindly providing us with for the event. For the
majority of the day, I attended various talks in the area of embedded systems
and IoT development as this is the area I was spending my current year working
in. 

A talk that I really enjoyed was the [The IoT botnet
wars](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/iot_botnet/) talk as it covered a
couple botnets from the last few years which I had not read into in much detail.
The talk covered 3 main botnets, Mirai, BrickerBot and Hajime. The primary
take-aways from this talk were that embedded devices should have some form of
OTA update available, and time should be taken during development to check for
these typical routes of entry into a system to help protect against these
massive IoT based attacks. 
Another talk which I really enjoyed was [AI on
Microcontrollers](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/utensor/) which was a
relatively new open source development for running TensorFlow models on MCU
powered devices. The talk covered the struggles with using machine learning
techniques on embedded systems powered by MCUs. The struggles with memory and
Âµtensor's approach to solving this. Overall the talk was well presented and was
pitched at a reasonable level for those less informed on the matter of machine
learning techniques.

At the end of the day, the final key note talk was [Exploiting modern
microarchitectures](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/closing_keynote/)
which was definitely expected this year, a great talk given by [Jon
Masters](https://twitter.com/jonmasters) from Red Hat. The talk was admittedly
rushed as it was a 2+ hour talk compressed into 50 minutes, but the talk was
fantastic. Jon pitched the talk at a perfect level, covering the basics of
computer architecture required to understand the exploits prior to explaining
the exploits themselves. I recommend anyone interested in these exploits watch
this talk [here](https://video.fosdem.org/2018/Janson/closing_keynote.webm).

## Cleaning Up
For yet another year the great community who attend this conference every
year, showed up to help the organisers clear up at the end of the weekend. This
time of the weekend suprises me every year, making me realise truly how great
the open source community is, banding together to help make this event possible
year after year.
